# Mark and Sweep Garbage Collector

A mark-and-sweep garbage collector implementation in C++.

*Note: This README was reformatted with assistance from Claude 4.*

## Progress

### Completed
- ✅ **Custom allocator** - Implementation complete and tested
- ✅ **Stack scanner** - Implementation complete and tested  
- ✅ **Garbage collector** - Implemented but has missing features and needs further testing. 

## TODO (Priority Order)

### High Priority
1. **Clean up** - Refactor, simplify... remove depracted files or tests...

### Medium Priority  
2. **Comprehensive testing** - Expand test coverage beyond basic functionality

## Development Status
Currently debugging the core GC algorithm. The foundation components (allocator and stack scanner) are stable. 

## AI use transparency 
chatGPT and Claude used for discussing ideas, help with debugging, and help with C++ language use, as well used to review code quality. 
No AI IDE copilot was used.
