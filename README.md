# Mark and Sweep Garbage Collector

A mark-and-sweep garbage collector implementation in C++.

*Note: This README was reformatted with assistance from Claude 4.*

## Progress

### Completed
- ✅ **Custom allocator** - Implementation complete and tested
- ✅ **Stack scanner** - Implementation complete and tested  
- ✅ **Garbage collector** - Implemented but has missing features and needs further testing. 

## TODO (Priority Order)

### High Priority
1. **Implement soft free** - Implement soft manual free functionaliy.


### Medium Priority 
2. **Implement smarter allocation** - Based on wheter allocation type is pointer or not, flag it on heapchunk. 
3. **Comprehensive testing** - Expand test coverage beyond basic functionality

### Low Priority
4. **Optimize datastructures and their use** - focus on implementing functionality first, *"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil."*
5. **Optimize algorithms** - *"We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil."*


## Development Status


## AI use transparency 
chatGPT and Claude used for discussing ideas, help with debugging, and help with C++ language use, as well used to review code quality. 
No AI IDE copilot was used.
